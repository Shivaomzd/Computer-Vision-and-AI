Why do we process images?
1- Picture Digitization for facilitate transmission, printing and storage of pictures.
2- Picture enhancement and restoration
3- Picture segmentation and description as an early stage to Machine Vision.

Levels of Image Processing
1-Low Level: which is including basic operations like contrast enhancement, noise reduction, image sharpening,etc. Both inputs and outputs of these operations are images.
2- Medium Level: including Segmentation operations, object classification and object recognition. Inputs are generally images but outputs are edges, contours, etc.
3- High Level: including representation and description.
