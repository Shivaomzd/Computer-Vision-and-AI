You can Googgle "What is Artificial Intelligence?" term to get numerous results. I like how Eugene Charniak answers to this question in his book "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" the most;
"Artificial Intelligence", he says "is the study of mental faculties through the use of computational methods." In some sense, when talk about mental faculties, we're approaching it from a more psychological viewpoint which I beleive, is true to some extent because machines just like humans are struggling with choosing among options.
There are sensory inputs (Vision and Language) and with the help of these faculties (deduction, reasoning, etc.), ther person choose how to react to their evironment. Further, gets the feedbacks and try to learn from them to make their decisions more beneficial to themselves.
This is the main purpose of this field; To make machines apply simulated faculties of human's mind to develope their performance to perform similar to humans gradually and in some aspects even better than them.
