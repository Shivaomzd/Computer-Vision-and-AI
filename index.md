title: Welcome to my blog

In this blog, I try to share what I have been learning in Computer Vision and AI fields step by step. For doing so, I will start with fundamentals of Computer Vision specially Image Processing techniques.   
As an Agile Practitioner, I will try to follow the famous "KISS" principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid! :D) and improve the blog sprint by sprint! Hope what I have learnt can be helpfull to all of you my friends. I will be happy to have your invaluable feedbacks! :)
